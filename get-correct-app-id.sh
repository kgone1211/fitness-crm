echo "============================="
echo ""

echo "📋 Step 1: Check Whop Dashboard"
echo "1. Go to https://whop.com/dashboard"
echo "2. Look for your apps"
echo "3. Find 'Fitness CRM' or any app you created"
echo "4. Click on the app to see its details"
echo ""

echo "📋 Step 2: Get the App ID"
echo "In the app details, you'll see:"
echo "- App ID: app_XXXXXXXXX (this is what we need)"
echo "- App Name: Fitness CRM"
echo "- App URL: (should be your Vercel URL)"
echo ""

echo "📋 Step 3: Check App Status"
echo "Make sure the app is:"
echo "- Published (not draft)"
echo "- Active"
echo "- Has the correct App URL set"
echo ""

echo "📋 Step 4: Test the Installation Link"
echo "The installation link should be:"
echo "https://whop.com/apps/APP_ID_HERE/install/"
echo ""
echo "Replace APP_ID_HERE with the actual app ID from step 2"
echo ""

echo "📋 Step 5: Tell Me the App ID"
echo "Once you find the correct app ID, tell me:"
echo "- The app ID (e.g., app_XXXXXXXXX)"
echo "- Whether it's published"
echo "- Whether the App URL is set correctly"
echo ""

echo "🔧 Common Issues:"
echo "- App might be in draft status (needs to be published)"
echo "- App URL might not be set"
echo "- App might have a different ID than expected"
echo ""

echo "💡 The app ID in the files (app_6ZskuhNqu7LD9V) might not exist"
echo "We need to find the actual app ID from your Whop dashboard"
