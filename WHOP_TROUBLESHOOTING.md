# üîç Whop App Not Showing - Troubleshooting Guide

## Step 1: Check Your Vercel Deployment
First, make sure your app is deployed and accessible:

1. **Get your Vercel URL:**
   - Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Find your `fitness-crm` project
   - Copy the production URL (e.g., `https://fitness-crm-vercel.vercel.app`)

2. **Test direct access:**
   - Visit your Vercel URL directly
   - App should load immediately without loading screen
   - If it doesn't work, fix Vercel deployment first

## Step 2: Check Whop App Configuration

### Option A: Whop Dashboard
1. Go to [Whop Dashboard](https://whop.com/dashboard)
2. Find your app: `app_6ZskuhNqu7LD9V`
3. Check these settings:

**App Configuration:**
- **App URL**: Must be your Vercel URL (e.g., `https://fitness-crm-vercel.vercel.app`)
- **Redirect URI**: Must be your Vercel URL
- **Homepage**: Must be your Vercel URL
- **Status**: Must be "Active" or "Published"

**App Details:**
- **App ID**: `app_6ZskuhNqu7LD9V`
- **Name**: Fitness CRM
- **Description**: A comprehensive fitness CRM application...

### Option B: Whop CLI
```bash
# Check app status
whop apps get app_6ZskuhNqu7LD9V

# Update app URL (replace with your actual Vercel URL)
whop apps update app_6ZskuhNqu7LD9V --app-url https://YOUR-VERCEL-URL.vercel.app
```

## Step 3: Verify App is Published
Your app must be published to appear in Whop:

1. In Whop Dashboard, go to your app
2. Look for "Publish" or "Make Live" button
3. Ensure the app status is "Published" or "Live"
4. If it's in "Draft" status, publish it

## Step 4: Test Installation Link
Try the installation link:
`https://whop.com/apps/app_6ZskuhNqu7LD9V/install/`

**Expected behavior:**
- Should show app details
- Should have "Install App" button
- Should redirect to your Vercel app when installed

## Step 5: Check App Visibility
Make sure your app is visible:

1. **Public visibility**: App should be set to public
2. **Categories**: Should be in "fitness" or "crm" category
3. **Search**: Try searching for "Fitness CRM" in Whop

## Step 6: Common Issues & Solutions
