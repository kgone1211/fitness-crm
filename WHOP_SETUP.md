### 3. **Deploy Your App**

For your app to show in Whop, it needs to be publicly accessible:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel

# Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
```

**Option B: Deploy to Netlify**
```bash
# Build the app
npm run build

# Deploy to Netlify
# Upload the 'out' folder to Netlify
```

**Option C: Deploy to Railway**
```bash
# Connect your GitHub repo to Railway
# Railway will automatically deploy
```

### 4. **Update Environment Variables**

After deployment, update your production environment variables:

```env
WHOP_API_KEY=pReJrNujmBUQWtoF2HVvVxV0QhVOmP_FuX2sW04vjgI
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID=app_CG40lYJTdvm70y

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Visit http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Whop Testing:**
   - Go to your Whop company dashboard
   - Look for your app in the "Apps" section
   - Click "Install" to test the integration

### 6. **App Manifest**

Your app includes a `whop-manifest.json` file that Whop can read to understand your app's capabilities. This is located at:
- `https://your-domain.com/whop-manifest.json`

### 7. **Troubleshooting**

**App not showing in Whop:**
- âœ… Ensure your app is publicly accessible (not localhost)
- âœ… Check that all required permissions are granted
- âœ… Verify your app ID matches in both Whop and your environment
- âœ… Make sure your redirect URIs are correctly configured

**Authentication issues:**
- âœ… Verify your API key is correct
- âœ… Check that your app ID matches
- âœ… Ensure your company ID is correct

**Development vs Production:**
- For development: Use `http://localhost:3000`
- For production: Use your deployed domain
- Update redirect URIs accordingly

### 8. **Next Steps**

Once your app is live in Whop:

1. **Monitor Usage:** Check Whop analytics for app usage
2. **Gather Feedback:** Collect user feedback through Whop
3. **Iterate:** Update your app based on user needs
4. **Scale:** Add more features as your user base grows
