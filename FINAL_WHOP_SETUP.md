## üîç Why It Might Not Show in Whop

### **Most Common Issues:**

1. **App Path Not Set**: Make sure "App Path" is set to `/whop` in Whop dashboard
2. **Embedding Disabled**: Ensure "Allow Embedding" is enabled
3. **App Not Active**: Check that your app status is "Active" in Whop
4. **Wrong URL**: Verify the App URL is exactly `https://client-tracking-lovat.vercel.app`
5. **Missing Environment Variables**: All 5 variables must be set in Vercel

### **Step-by-Step Checklist:**

- [ ] App is deployed to Vercel successfully
- [ ] All 5 environment variables are set in Vercel
- [ ] App Path is set to `/whop` in Whop dashboard
- [ ] "Allow Embedding" is enabled in Whop dashboard
- [ ] App status is "Active" in Whop dashboard
- [ ] Redirect URI matches exactly: `https://client-tracking-lovat.vercel.app/api/auth/whop/callback`
- [ ] You can access `https://client-tracking-lovat.vercel.app/whop` directly

## üìû If Still Not Working

1. **Check Vercel Logs**: Look for any deployment or runtime errors
2. **Test Direct URLs**: Make sure all URLs work when accessed directly
3. **Contact Whop Support**: They can help verify your app configuration
4. **Check App Status**: Ensure your app is approved and active in Whop

## üéâ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
- ‚úÖ App appears in your Whop dashboard
- ‚úÖ You can click on it and it loads in an iframe
- ‚úÖ OAuth flow works (redirects to Whop login)
- ‚úÖ User data is passed back to your app

The key is the **App Path** setting - it must be `/whop` for Whop to know where to load your app!
