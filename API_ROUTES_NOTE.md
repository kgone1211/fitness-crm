# API Routes Note

## ⚠️ Important: API Routes Moved

The API routes have been temporarily moved to `api-backup/` directory because:

1. **Static Export Limitation**: Next.js static export (`output: 'export'`) doesn't support API routes
2. **Whop Deployment**: Direct Whop deployment requires static files only

## 📁 Current Status

- **API Routes Location**: `api-backup/src/app/api/`
- **Build Output**: `out/` directory (static files only)
- **Deployment**: Ready for Whop direct deployment

## 🔄 Restoring API Routes

If you need API routes back:

1. **Move API routes back:**
   ```bash
   mv api-backup/src/app/api src/app/
   ```

2. **Update next.config.js:**
   ```javascript
   // Remove or comment out:
   output: 'export',
   ```

3. **Redeploy to Vercel or other platforms that support API routes**

## 🚀 Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Hybrid Deployment
- **Frontend**: Deploy to Whop (static files)
- **API**: Deploy to Vercel/Netlify (API routes)
- **Connection**: Use environment variables

### Option 2: External API
- Use external API services (Supabase, Firebase, etc.)
- Update your app to use external endpoints
- Keep static deployment for Whop

### Option 3: Client-Side Data
- Move all data operations to client-side
- Use localStorage or external databases
- No server-side API needed

## 📝 Current App Functionality

**✅ Working (Static):**
- All UI components
- Client portal
- Trainer dashboard
- Navigation
- Forms (UI only)
- Charts and analytics

**❌ Not Working (No API):**
- Data persistence
- Real-time updates
- Server-side processing
- Database operations

## 🔧 Quick Fix for Development

To restore full functionality for local development:

```bash
# Restore API routes
mv api-backup/src/app/api src/app/

# Update next.config.js (remove output: 'export')
# Then run:
npm run dev
```

## 📚 Next Steps

1. **For Whop**: Keep current static setup
2. **For Full Features**: Consider hybrid deployment
3. **For Development**: Restore API routes as needed

**Note**: This is a temporary solution for Whop deployment. The app can be easily restored to full functionality by moving the API routes back.
